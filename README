Editor.js is a collaborative editor based on javascript technology both for frontend and for backend.
Its a proof of concept to apply simple libraries and tools. There is no multi document/persistence for now.

Based on
  Node.js ( http://nodejs.org )
  Diff Match Patch ( http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/ )
  A patch to Diff Match Patch to run from node.js (included, it's dead simple)
  pubsub_ws ( http://github.com/gleicon/pubsub_ws )

The algorithm is very simple. Each browser has an internal editing buffer which is diff'ed against the text area, and the resulting patches are broadcasted using websockets to everyone connected.

Whenever the server receives a patch, it applies against its internal editing buffer, so new clientes will receive the full buffer.

Running:

- Place the contents from frontend/ folder in your webserver;
- $ cd backend; node backend/collab_editor.js
- Open some browsers. Make sure the backend port is open for your network
